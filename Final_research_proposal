The effects of climate change on vegetation 

Introduction
	Climate change is one of the greatest threats facing the planet. Since the Industrial Revolution, human have been actively releasing CO2 into the atmosphere by burning of fossil fuels. This excess amount of CO2 into the atmosphere traps more infrared radiation that would otherwise be reflected to outer space. The mean global atmospheric CO2 concentration increased by 9% during 1980-2000 (Nemani et al, 2003). As a consequence, global average temperature has been rising. According to NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8° Celsius since 1880. 
	Most of the observed climatic changes have been reducing climatic constraints to the growth of primary producers, such as increase in CO2 and temperature results in higher rate of photosynthesis. Although most studies reached a consensus that climate change resulted in an increased of net primary productivity in terrestrial and marine ecosystems (Nemani et al, 2003; Brown et al, 2013), the effects of temperature changes on vegetation are still undetermined. Some studies show increased temperature leads to a decrease in vegetation (Jin et al, 2008), other studies shows increased temperature leads to a increase in vegetation (Zhang et al, 2013). Aside from temperature change, these papers also suggest that rainfall pattern could potentially be a factor in determining the change in vegetation. 
	The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of temperature and rainfall pattern on vegetation change. The leading hypothesis is that increased temperature and rainfall would lead to a upward shift of vegetation because the higher elevation provides a more suitable environment for the plant species and the whole vegetation.

Methods
	In order to investigate the effect of temperature and rainfall on vegetation, I’ve acquired three difference datasets: temperature data and rainfall data from Taiwan Climate Change and Information Platform (TCCIP), and vegetation data extracted from NASA’s AVHRR satellites. All three dataset is from 1982 to 2012, so I can look at the changes over the past 31 years. For the purpose of this research, all data will be focused on high elevation (above 3000m), in order to avoid direct human disturbance. We are expected to run simple linear regression and multiple linear regression to determine the significance of temperature and rainfall on vegetation. 

Expected outcomes and significance 
	I expect to find evidence of rising temperature due to climate change and an upward shift on vegetation as a response of the rise in temperature. The shift in vegetation is well documented in many scientific papers, that vegetation will always be responsive to climate change. Furthermore, I would also expect to see some changes in rainfall pattern, although I’m not sure if the change will be a increasing or a decreasing trend. I suspect that temperature and rainfall are the two major variables that dictates the changes in vegetation. 
	The significance of this studies is the ability to predicts changes in vegetation when we know about temperature and rainfall data. Therefore, we could apply the model to other location and expect a similar outcome. For example, if we established that increase temperature and rainfall leads to an upward shift of vegetation. Then we could expect the same outcome when temperature and rainfall increase in other location. 
	This research could leads to our understanding of conservation effort on preserving the vegetation. Future research can look into the productivity and diversity of the vegetation after the shift, and the effect on the ecosystem.
